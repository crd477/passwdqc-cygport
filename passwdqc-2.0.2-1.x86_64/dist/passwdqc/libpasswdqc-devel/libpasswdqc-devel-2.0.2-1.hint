ldesc: "passwdqc is a password/passphrase strength checking and policy
enforcement toolset, including command-line programs (pwqcheck, pwqfilter,
and pwqgen), and a library (libpasswdqc).

pwqcheck and pwqgen are standalone password/passphrase strength checking
and random passphrase generator programs, respectively, which are usable
from scripts. The pwqfilter program searches, creates, or updates binary
passphrase filter files, which can also be used with pwqcheck.

libpasswdqc is the underlying library, which can also be used from
third-party programs."
